  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    Hi, I’m Samhita. I’m someone who loves tech, yes — 
    but that’s not the only thing about me.
  </p>

  <h2>Bharatanatyam</h2>
  <p>
    I’ve been learning Bharatanatyam for years. 
    It’s something that’s very close to me. 
    I don’t think I can explain it properly, but when I dance, 
    it just feels right. It’s not about performance. 
    It’s just something that’s part of me.
  </p>

  <h2>Veena</h2>
  <p>
    I play the veena too. It’s calm, slow, and requires patience. 
    Sometimes I sit and play just for myself. 
    It’s one of those things that makes me feel grounded.
  </p>

  <h2>Sports</h2>
  <p>
    I enjoy sports a lot — badminton, volleyball, throwball. 
    I like being active. I like the energy. 
    It balances out the time I spend studying or working on my laptop.
  </p>

  <h2>Karate</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a karate brown belt. 
    Training wasn’t always easy, but I stuck with it. 
    It taught me to push through even when I didn’t feel like it.
  </p>

  <h2>Spelling Bee</h2>
  <p>
    I’ve competed at an international level in spelling competitions. 
    That experience meant a lot to me. 
    Standing there and spelling under pressure was scary, 
    but it made me more confident over time.
  </p>

  <h2>Future</h2>
  <p>
    I’m interested in cybersecurity and want to build my future in that field. 
    I’m still learning and figuring things out, 
    but I know I want to grow into someone capable and independent.
